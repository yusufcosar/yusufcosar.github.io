## Introduction

I, as a student, studying Information Systems and Technologies program at Mersin University. I am currently taking third class of my program.

I'm interested in develop C# and web-based applications. I previously made online radio broadcasting systems for schools.

### Points of Interest

I enjoy using linux distrobutions because of lightweightness in terms of both disk size and usage ease.

sudo su
apt update
apt dist-upgrade -y
```

One of my hobbies is wireless communications. I've done some soldering of oscillators and connecting them home-made antennas. Later, I comparised my antennas and 50 ohm resistors in terms of efficiency as dBm. I also have a 88-108 MHz FM transmittor which its antenna made by me. It has a aux input that can be connected to mobile phone for music broadcast and it has a micropohone on it for speech broadcast. It's range is 3-5 meters.
